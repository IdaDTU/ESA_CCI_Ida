# To Do

## Task 3.1: Estimation of sea-ice concentration, ice type and extent including uncertainties
- [x] N5 NEMS  
  - [x] BIAS MODEL
    - [x] Sensitivty study (Note: Bias correction with average correction on each data  ) 
    - [ ] Close gaps
- [ ] N6 ESMR  
- [ ] N6 SCAMS  
- [ ] Grids depending on footprints  

## Task 3.2: Assess overlapping records for combining datasets
- [ ] Identify overlapping time periods  
- [ ] Quantify measurement differences  
- [ ] Define merging strategy with uncertainty propagation  

## Task 3.3: Compute and publish the combined sea-ice record
- [ ] Implement combination algorithm  
- [ ] Validate combined record against independent references    

## Other
- [x] Co-locate with Era5  
  - [ ] Tb with validation data other than Era5
- [ ] Find dynamical tiepoints for ice in SIC alghoritm
-   [ ] MYI vs FYI
  - [ ] Antarctica
  - [ ] Arctic
